# Data Visualisation with R 

This block will be divided into two sections from 14:00-15:45 and 16:00-18:00 on Tuesday the 8th of June.  

The focus will be on data visualisation, with a basic understanding of R and R Studio assumed.

## Topics

* Different types of plots and when and where each might be best used 
* The pitfalls of misleading data visualisation 
* Deeper customisation of plots, including labels, colour maps, and re-sizing/re-positioning legends 
* Basic integration of statistical analysis with data visualisation 
* Exporting plots
