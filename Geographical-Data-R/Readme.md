# Geographical Data with R 

This block will be divided into two sections from 14:00-15:45 and 16:00-18:00 on Wednesday the 9th of June.  
The focus will be on Geographical Data, with a basic understanding of R and R Studio assumed. 
This block will provide a solid base for understanding Geographical Data Analysis with R, and will allow attendees to apply and develop the core concepts to their own work and/or research. 

## Topics
* Basic understanding of Geographical Data, including vectors, rasters, .shp files and .tif files 
* Plotting simple geographical features with plot() 
* The use and benefits of sf() and rgdal() for geographical data analysis with R 
* Deeper customisation of Geographical data, including labels, colour maps, re-sizing/re-positioning legends and adjusting extent/scale 
* Overlaying Geographical features for more complex analysis 
* Exporting plots 


## Installation
In this workshop, we are going to use the following packages, please run the following codes in your R console if you have not installed before:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rgdal")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("raster")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("sp")
install.packages("latticeExtra")
```

## Course Materials
In this repositary, you will find a  script (`Geographic_Data.R`) and 2 folders Data and Output. The Data Folder contains all the data we are going to use and the Output folder will be used to save the graph we are going to create. For your convenience, you can also download from the following link: https://github.com/DCS-training/CDCS-Summer-School/tree/main/Zipped-Files. The contents are identical.

Please make sure to download and unzip the folder in an easily accessible place in your machine.
