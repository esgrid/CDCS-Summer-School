Full statement from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross “These are some of the devastating documents that the First Minister hoped would never get out. The SNP fought two votes in the Scottish Parliament to shut them down and waited until after Nicola Sturgeon’s evidence session to release it. “It’s beyond dispute that the government hid evidence from their own lawyers and then “discounted” their advice, as Roddy Dunlop QC put it. “These new documents show Nicola Sturgeon thought she was a better lawyer than Queen’s Counsel. She was emphatically wrong and it cost taxpayers more than £500,000. “The government was advised to concede a month before they did. Then they ran up an even bigger bill for weeks after they had been told the case was unstatable, the minimum requirement to proceed. “Their case was doomed from the start but they hid the evidence from their own lawyers, to the embarrassment and utter dismay of Roddy Dunlop QC. “The fact there are missing minutes from the meeting that Nicola Sturgeon herself attended confirms this is a cover up. Crucial evidence has been hidden. “The SNP thought Nicola Sturgeon had been exonerated by an evidence session where she failed to answer questions more than 100 times. “After the revelations of these latest documents, the First Minister’s position is more unstable than ever.
