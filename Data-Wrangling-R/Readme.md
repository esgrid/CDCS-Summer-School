# Data Wrangling with R 

This block will be divided into two sections from 14:00-15:45 and 16:00-18:00 on Monday the 7th of June.  

The focus will be on Data Wrangling and manipulation, but will begin with an introduction to the basic concepts and functionalities of R.

This workshop will provide a solid base for understanding the functionality of R, as well as the basics of Data Wrangling with R. This will allow attendees to apply and develop the core concepts to their own work and/or research. 

## Topics
* Basic understanding of working directories and file locations 
* Basic functionality of R, including calculations, variables, packages and classes of data 
* Importing and reading datasets 
* Subsetting datasets and changing data classes 
* Efficient data tidying 
* Merging and exporting datasets 


## Installation
In this workshop, we are going to see how to install packages so you do not have to do it beforehand if you do not know how to do but the package we are going to use is tidyverse

```
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

## Course Materials
In this repositary, you will find a  script (`Data_wrangling.R`) and 2 folders one with the dataset we are going to use (**Data**) and one that we are going to use for saving the outputs (**Output**). For your convenience, you can also download from the following link: https://github.com/DCS-training/CDCS-Summer-School/tree/main/Zipped-Files. The contents are identical.
